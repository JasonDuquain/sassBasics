watch videos in this order 02-01 - 02-06, 03-03 - 03-05, ALL OF 04

start at video 02-01 - nested selectors..that is where style.scss - COMPLETE is at..so start with style.scss and complete up until it matches styles- COMPLETE. Then at that point start following the vids starting at 02-01

just use 4 partial files: helpers, main-styles., mixins and variables..the teacher adds many more in 03-01 but dont do it
